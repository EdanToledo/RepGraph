TLDEDA001 CHNROY002 CHNJAR003


Description
---
The meaning of a sentence can be represented by a graph in which the nodes represent
concepts, entities or actions, and the edges represent relations between the edges, indicating
who does what to whom. Nodes and edges are labelled, and every node is linked to a word or a
phrase in the sentence. Meaning representation graphs are used in question answering
systems and other natural language processing applications. 


Purpose
---

This project visualises and analyses these meaning representation graphs.

Technical Details:
